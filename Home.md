NextPVR is free for personal, non-commercial use. Commercial use requires a license. You can contact us via the https://nextpvr.com website if you need a commercial license. 

### Where does it get TV from?
NextPVR can get TV from a wide variety of different sources. The list of sources varies depend on the platform you've installed NextPVR on.

* **On Windows:** IPTV, HDHomeRun, SAT>IP, DVB and ATSC tuners, HDPVR and other HDMI devices

* **On Linux:** IPTV, HDHomeRun, SAT>IP, DVB and ATSC tuners

* **On Docker:** IPTV, HDHomeRun, SAT>IP, DVB and ATSC tuners

* **On Mac:** IPTV, HDHomeRun, SAT>IP

All platforms also support the 'Extras' plugin, which allow users to add addition sources which would otherwise not be natively supported, such as HDPVR on Linux etc. For more details see [Extras](Extras)

### Where does it get TV Listings from?
It varies depending on the source and platform. For SAT>IP and DVB sources, it will default to getting listings directly from the broadcasts. Often this will give you a week or so of decent listings. 

IPTV sources will default to the XMLTV source supplied when importing your IPTV channels.

NextPVR also supports Schedules Direct and XMLTV. Schedules Direct is usually required for North American users, where broadcast listings are often inadequate for use in a PVR. 

### Who is behind NextPVR?
NextPVR is developed by a New Zealander named Graeme Blackley. The project also has the invaluable support from a few key members of the NextPVR community at https://forums.nextpvr.com
