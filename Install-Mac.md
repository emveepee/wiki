On macOS, NextPVR supports IPTV, HDHomeRun tuners, and SAT>IP tuner (DVB-S, DVB-C, DVB-T).

The latest macOS 64bit files can be downloaded from:

### To install on macOS
Copy binaries to directory an NPVR directory in your home directory, and execute the following commands from a terminal window. 

> cd NPVR <br/>
> chmod +x ./NextPVRServer<br/>
> ./NextPVRServer<br/>

To watch video in the web app on a mac, you'll also need to have ffmpeg installed on the machine. You'll also find it easier to use Chrome than Safari if you intend to view video in the web application, since Safari actively tries to stop NextPVR from autoplaying any (on the assumption it's some advert trying to autoplay)

### Installing on Catalina 
For users installing on macOS Catalina, you're likely to get errors about being unable to verify the developer. Information about getting that can be found here: https://forums.nextpvr.com/showthread.php?tid=59995&page=2
